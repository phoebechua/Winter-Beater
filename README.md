# Winter Beater
Winter Beater is a GUI that utilizes combinatorial optimization techniques to determine the shortest route between campus buildings frequented by Messiah College students.
 
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) formulated by Hamilton and Kirkman is a natural setting for the problem solved by the program. TSP poses the following question: Given a list of cities and their pairwise distances, what is the shortest route that visits each place exactly once? 
 
To solve this problem, this program uses a branch and bound recursive tree search to determine the shortest tour. 

## Getting Started
To use the program, [download the project's source code](https://github.com/phoebechua/winter-beater/archive/master.zip) and run src > WinterBeater2.java. 

## Built With
* Java
* Python - Used in the initial work to calculate the distance between two locations
